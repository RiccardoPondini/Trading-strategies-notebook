This repository presents a comprehensive collection of trading strategies inspired by Kakushadze & Serur’s "151 Trading Strategies", implemented and critically analyzed in Python. The strategies span traditional technical analysis methods, statistical models, and machine learning approaches, providing an overview of quantitative trading techniques.

The project includes:

-- Momentum and Volatility-Based Strategies --
Explores trend-following and risk-anomaly patterns using cumulative returns and standard deviation rankings.

-- Residual Momentum --
Applies the Fama-French three-factor model to isolate stock-specific momentum signals.

-- Pairs Trading --
Implements a mean-reversion strategy using historical correlations and demeaned returns.

-- Technical Indicator Strategy --
Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossover analysis (50/200 period) as a signal for bullish/bearish regimes.

-- Machine Learning – KNN --
Utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for stock movement prediction, including cross-validation and out-of-sample evaluation.

-- Time Series Forecasting – ARIMA & SARIMA --
Applies autoregressive models for forecasting Amazon’s stock price, including model identification via ACF/PACF and auto-ARIMA.
